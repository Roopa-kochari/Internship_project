**Flight Fare Prediction**
Predict airline ticket prices using machine learning and real-world flight data.

**Overview**
This project aims to build a robust machine learning model that estimates flight fares using features like airline, source, destination, route, stops, timing, and journey duration. The workflow includes data cleaning, feature engineering, categorical data encoding, visualization, and regression modeling.

**Features**
-Data cleaning and preprocessing
-Feature extraction (days, duration, stops, etc.)
-Categorical encoding (One-Hot and Frequency encoding)
-Visualization of trends and relationships
-Regression models for fare prediction
-Supports easy extension and experimentation

**Technologies Used**
-Python
-Pandas, NumPy
-Scikit-learn
-Matplotlib/Seaborn

**Dataset Fields**
-Airline
-Source
-Destination
-Route
-TotalStops

**Departure & Arrival time details**
-Journey date components
-Duration
-Price
